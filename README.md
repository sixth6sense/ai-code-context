## Usage

After installation, you can start using AI Code Context in your project. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Set Up Git Hooks**:
   You can configure git hooks to automatically generate documentation on every commit. To do this, add the following to your `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   npm run generate-docs
   ```

2. **Generate Documentation**:
   To manually generate documentation, use the CLI:
   ```bash
   ai-code-context generate
   ```

3. **View Documentation**:
   The generated documentation will be available in the `docs` directory. Open `index.html` to view it in your browser.

## How It Works

AI Code Context uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze your code changes and generate meaningful documentation. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Git Diff Analysis**: The tool captures the changes made in your codebase using git diffs.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The AI processes these changes to understand the context and purpose behind them.
3. **Documentation Generation**: Based on the analysis, the tool creates documentation that explains what has changed and why.

This process ensures that your documentation remains relevant and helpful, reflecting the latest state of your code.
